# authentication-demo

This demo project is designed to showcase front end web development skills in a short timeframe. Given 8 hours, some design and ux specifications, coffee, and a quiet series of evenings, how slick can I make a simple login/register application? This is my answer.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
